# **Hello there!**
## *My name is Victoria, or Tori, Crismon*

I am a senior at the University of Missouri and I am currently working towards a _Bachelors of Science degree in Applied Economics._ With this major, I am able to broaden my horizons and learn subjects complementing my own interest in the economy.

# **Introduction**
### _Who am I? Why am I here? How did I get here?_

Born at the start of the millennium, all the way to present day, it's hard to answer who I am exactly, I am simply a girl in a shop writing markdown on her laptop.

*Some things about me:*
- I love movies and televison shows.
    - I use [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) to both find movies and leave my own reviews once I have watched them.
    - [Here](https://letterboxd.com/torichristmas/) is a link to my profile.
- My favorite color is either red or electric blue

- I enjoy the arts and learning about anything and everything

# What is the Difference Between Economics and Applied Economics?
In simple terms, *economics* is the field of study that focuses on the transfer of goods and wealth between consumers and producers. Similarly, *applied economics* is expressed through joining economic theory and statistics to study the causes and effcets of said transfers.

## How does it Relate to Information Technology (IT)
 In a subject that is so heavily reliant on quantitative data, it is important for economists to know and understand programming languages to properly categorize and evaluate large groups of data. 

**Personal:** Although I am a beginner, I am learning and navigating through these softwares to help me conduct research and understand quantitative variables in the future when I am part of the work force.
- An example of some of the work I've done using Python in the List_Loop activity: 
    >number_list= [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20]
   '# how many numbers in list'
    > print("number of integers:",len(number_list))
    #find the sum of all numbers
    > print("sum of integers:", sum(number_list))
    #find average
    > print("average:", sum(number_list)/len(number_list))
    #all numbers with index 
    > index = 0
    > while index < len(number_list):
        > print("integer at index", index, number_list[index])
         > index += 1
        > print()
    > #print every other number with their index  
    > for index in range(0, len(number_list), 2):
        > print("integer at index", index, number_list[index])

# **Global Significance of IT and Economics**
## Why is it good to be familair with both?
The two compliment eachother in their resepctive fields. In economics, it makes it easier to compile large sets of data in a more cohesive and comprehendable group, as opposing to making large tedious sheets with all the data that's needed to complete a study or project.

# **Closing Remarks**
I'm learning programming languages and programs to further expand my knowledge and help myself grow in the field that I am hoping to enter, I hope you enjoyed my work through this process. 
## Thank You!
